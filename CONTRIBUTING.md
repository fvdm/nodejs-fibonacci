Development
-----------

### Clone sourcecode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-fibonacci
cd nodejs-fibonacci
```

### Branches

The `master` branch is always exactly the same as the
package release on npm.

While the `develop` branch is where development happens
towards the next release.

When you intent to submit a PR always base your work on
the `develop` branch and then work from a new branch.


```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b mycode
npm install
```


### Pull Requests

When you intent to submit a PR, please follow these instructions:


#### Code

* Stick to the code style.
* Run `npm test` to make sure it all works.
* JSdoc the functions.


```js

### Semantic versioning:

> **Warning:** Do not update the `package.json` version on your own.
> Only the package maintainer must do that.

The package version must follow this format: **major.minor.patch**

* **major** are breaking changes to the interface and package
* **minor** are new features, new configs to the interface
* **patch** are bugfixes, security patches, chores, docs, other changes

Changes to Test scripts, development files, etc. should not bump the version.
